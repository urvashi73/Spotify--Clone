# Spotify--Clone
This project is a Spotify Clone (Frontend Only) built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the basic look and feel of Spotify's user interface, including the homepage, navigation bar, sidebar, and music player controls.

Features: Responsive Design – Ensures compatibility across various screen sizes. Navbar & Sidebar – Mimics Spotify’s layout with a sidebar for navigation and a top navbar. Album & Playlist Sections – Displays a grid of albums and playlists.

This project focuses solely on frontend implementation, without any backend functionality or music streaming. It serves as a great practice for HTML and CSS skills while improving UI/UX design abilities.
